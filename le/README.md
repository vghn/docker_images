Automatically create or renew certificates on startup and daily thereafter. It creates a temporary certificate first so that the load balancer (ex. HAProxy) is able to start with HTTPS active.
When choosing the `http` challenge (default), a basic web server is created for the authentication.
When choosing the 'dns' challenge (`PREFERRED_CHALLENGE=dns`) the TXT records of the specified domains will be updated. Currently only Cloudflare is supported

Based on https://quay.io/repository/letsencrypt/letsencrypt and https://github.com/cnadeau/letsencrypt-dockercloud-haproxy

### Changes:

#### Environment variables:
- `CERTBOT_EXTRA_OPTIONS`: additional arguments to `certbot` (e.g. `--staging`)

  ***VERY IMPORTANT***

  Make sure you set the environment variable `CERTBOT_EXTRA_OPTIONS='--staging'` on the letsencrypt
  service  until you are 100% sure you are configured properly and you want to get
  a real certificate. Otherwise you’ll reach the 5 certificates limit per domain
  per week and you’ll end up waiting a week before being able to regenerate a valid
  certificate if you didn’t backup the ones already generated

- `DOMAINS`: [required] a list of domains and subdomains. Certificates from different domains are separated by semi-colon (;) and subdomains are separated by comma (,).

  Ex: DOMAINS='foo.com,www.foo.com;bar.com,www.bar.com'

  Note that currently atypical domain names are not yet supported (Ex: subdomain.other subdomain.example.com.uk)

- `EMAIL`: [required] the email address to be used for all certificates

- `CRONJOB`: if this is `true` (default) the container will run as cron deamon with a daily task that renews the certificates

- `GENERATE_TEMP_CERTIFICATE`: useful if the certbot server is behind a load balancer and a certificate is required for it to start. A temporary self signed certificate will be created and used until the challenge is authenticated (defaults to `false`)

- `PREFERRED_CHALLENGE`: the preferred authentication method (defaults to `http`); possible values: `http`, `cloudflare`; if the API keys bellow are present it will try to autodetect it

- `CLOUDFLARE_EMAIL`: the email address to be used for dns authentication

- `CLOUDFLARE_API_KEY`: the Cloudflare Global API Key

  Or a docker swarm secret called `cloudflare_credentials.ini` which contains the email and api key, in the following format:

  ```
  # Cloudflare API credentials used by Certbot
  dns_cloudflare_email = cloudflare@example.com
  dns_cloudflare_api_key = 0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01234567
  ```

#### Packages:
- bash
- certbot
- curl
- jq
- openssl
- tini
