Automatically create or renew certificates on startup and daily thereafter.

Based on https://quay.io/repository/letsencrypt/letsencrypt and https://github.com/cnadeau/letsencrypt-dockercloud-haproxy


### Changes:

#### Environment variables:
- `OPTIONS`: additional arguments to `certbot` (e.g. `--staging`)

  ***VERY IMPORTANT***

  Make sure you set the environment variable OPTIONS: --staging on the letsencrypt
  service  until you are 100% sure you are configured properly and you want to get
  a real certificate. Otherwise you’ll reach the 5 certificates limit per domain
  per week and you’ll end up waiting a week before being able to regenerate a valid
  certificate if you didn’t backup the ones already generated

- `DOMAINS`: [required] a list of domains and subdomains. Certificates from different domains are separated by semi-colon (;) and subdomains are separated by comma (,).
  Ex: DOMAINS=foo.com,www.foo.com;bar.com,www.bar.com

- `EMAIL`: [required] the email address to be used for all certificates

- `LOAD_BALANCER_SERVICE_NAME`: [required] used to wait for this service to be listening on port 80 before starting the certbot service.

#### Packages:
- bash
- certbot
- openssl
